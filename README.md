# howdy! 👋
Charms10 is a forked version of CharmsBarPort and it's based off of .NET 7.0 and WPF (and C# too). I reimplemented a new method to make the network icon that is from the "CharmsClock" functional without having to stress the host CPU and make the app entirely lag.

**TLDR: better version of CharmsBarPort**

keep in mind that this is still in development (sorry for the bad news) but you can still manually build the app from the source code.

# 📋 To do list:
- Add themes support
- Add RTL Support
- ~~Add more languages~~ done now with Spanish, Chinese, Arabic, French, German, Japanese, Portugese, and Russian 🤯
- more coming soon..
