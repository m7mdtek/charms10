Charms10 is a forked version of CharmsBarPort and it's based off of .NET 7.0 and WPF (and C# too). I reimplemented a new method to make the network icon that is from the "CharmsClock" functional without having to stress the host CPU and make the app entirely lag.

keep in mind that this is still in development (sorry for the bad news) but you can still manually build the app from the source code.
